      <h3>How We Choose Books</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="card-body">
      <p class="card-text">
        Each month, we choose a book to read based on member suggestions and voting. We believe in making the selection process fun and democratic, so everyone gets a say. Whether it's a timeless classic or a contemporary bestseller, our book selection spans a wide range of genres to suit all tastes.
      </p>
      <p class="card-text">
        Our members often suggest books they've read in the past or ones that they’re excited to dive into. We also occasionally host themed months where we focus on specific genres such as fantasy, mystery, memoirs, or historical fiction. At the end of each month, we gather to discuss our thoughts on the book, share personal insights, and connect over our favorite parts.
